# mcts_kds

mcts_kds is a Python library used to apply Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to two player games that allows the current player to have complete information (eg. tictactoe, chess, othello)

To show how mcts works, I coded the game nim and created a mcts player to chose moves that would lead to a win. However, the purpose of creating this library was to allow others to apply the algorithm to games they program.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install mcts_kds.

```bash
pip install mcts_kds
```

## Usage

```python
import mcts_kds


```
